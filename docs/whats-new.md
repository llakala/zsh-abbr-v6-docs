Highlights in 6.x

- <Badge type="warning">Since 6.0.0</Badge> [History](./history.md)

    When expanding an abbreviation, optionally save the abbreviation to your shell history.

- <Badge type="warning">Since 6.0.0</Badge> [Prefixes](./prefixes.md)

    Configure strings and globs which can precede regular abbreviations. Out of the box, you can now do

    ```shell
    sudo <regular abbreviation>[Enter]
    ```

- <Badge type="warning">Since 6.0.0</Badge> [Reminders](./reminders.md)

    Optionally get "you have an abbreviation you could have used for the command you just ran" reminders. zsh-abbr can log the reminder messages to your terminal, or you can use the results in your own zsh hook.
