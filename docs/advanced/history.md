# History

:::danger
These docs are for the not-yet-released v6.  
For v5 docs see <https://zsh-abbr.olets.dev>
:::

With the default configuration, hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> after an abbreviation expands the abbreviation, runs the expansion, and saving the expansion to your shell history.

([Essential commands](../usage.md) covers the basics. [Widgets and key bindings](./widgets-and-key-bindings.md) covers how to change the trigger from <kbd>Enter</kbd> to something else.)

zsh-abbr's **history** support lets you opt into _also_ saving the abbreviation to your shell history.

Learn more at [Configuration variables](./configuration-variables.md) > `ABBR_EXPAND_AND_ACCEPT_PUSH_ABBREVIATED_LINE_TO_HISTORY`
and `ABBR_EXPAND_PUSH_ABBREVIATION_TO_HISTORY`.
